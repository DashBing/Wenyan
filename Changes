至于 PerlYuYan / 中书珨，则是第一篇过渡情境里的案头诗。

就像是在对自已说，既然楚辞可以当程式跑，所以之后写程式和写诗的意思一样。
写程式将亲人召唤至眼前，应与写诗将亲人召唤至眼前等价。

这确实是四岁小孩才会有的心理状态，但它无论如何主导了我 14~28 岁的人生过程。

(感谢 @godfat, @ilya 指正“射而不覆”，只讲谜面不讲谜底的习气。)
(感谢 @alevin 指正，其中 ancient romanticist poems 已改为 ancient Hellenic tragedies。）

文章里的“小孩”指的是我自已小时候的实际情况。

文章里的“楚辞”和“ancient Hellenic tragedies”是我 4~11 岁最常看的文学作品之二。

文章里的“婶婶叔叔姑姑姑丈”是4~8岁住在家里照顾我的许多真实存在的人。

文章里的“心脏病”指的是心室中隔缺损，造成心脏功率减半，无法运动也无法表现情绪，不然会晕倒。

文章里的“案头诗”指的是离开华文脉络即不构成意义的程式，也就是大部分的 OurNet::* 模组。

文章里的“诗剧”指的是 Pugs 及之后在 S-Team、CPAN、Hackage、Socialtext 等地的作品。

文章里的“Sinthome”指的是我一直停留在 4~8 岁的心理状态，想透过写程式将亲人召唤回身边，
而无瑕顾及名利诸染。

于写文章当天，发现世界己变，我不需经历社会化之过程，即能达成二十年前之初愿。

由此登入非想非非想处。

出定后，写下定处看到的见闻，是为心恸凡例。

(Based on a conversation from http://www.plurk.com/p/2ih40z)

“其实这想法很简单：
 NDS 上有一款 Scribblenaut 游戏，
 小孩画什么就会出现什么。”

The idea is actually simple. On 兔肝猴 there's a game called 撰空, where kids
can sketch out arbitrary concepts and it would automagically manifest in-game.

“从小看楚辞长大的小孩，
 自然就会希望自己写“昨夜西风凋碧树”
 就真的跑出碧树来。”

So a kid growing up reading ancient romanticist poems, would naturally wish
that penning "the sacred river Alph" and a river would actually appear.

“后来小孩长大了一点发现可以写程式做到这件事。
 就酱。:-)”

Then the kid grew up a bit and discovered programming can actually project
infantile omnipotence into a transitional zone. That's it. :-)

                                          ...

“后来照顾小孩的叔叔姑姑伯伯婶婶各自搬走，
 小孩心脏病很严重不能旅行，
 只能写诗想念他们。”

Shortly afterward, the kid's primary caretakers - many uncles and aunts - formed
families themselves and moved far away; the kid was born with severe ventricular
septal defect and cannot travel at all, so the kid poured wailing into poetry.

“后来发现这些诗只要押了特定的 P 韵脚，
 像是 TCP, UDP, IP, HTTP, XMPP，
 就有魔力。”

After a while, the kid had a discovery: As long as the poems rhymes on -协,
such as 传控协, 用信协, 跨协, 超文传协 and 扩讯现协, mysterious power would
appear out of nowhere.

“后来再大一点，和其他人一起写诗剧，
 演成噗浪和脸书，
 叔叔姑姑伯伯婶婶真的都进入诗的世界了。”

So the kid first wrote closet drama, and later learned to compose huge verses
based on multipart/mixed playwrights.

Then the Age of Melodrama came, and the scripts from the previous Age were
publicly performed on the stages of Twitter and Facebook.

And the Real uncles and aunts, still alive, now register into the kid's
Imaginary zone conjured from sheer Symbolic power.

“以上是对于拉冈 Sinthome 概念的实例讲解。:-)”

The above is a field report illustrating Lacan's idea of 心恸. :-)

13:48 <nothingmuch> use Time::HiRes qw(time);
13:48 <audreyt> right, it's the era of 64 bits
13:49 <nothingmuch> =)
...next...
13:51  * nothingmuch will use /usr/bin/uuidgen
13:52 <nothingmuch> since there's no concept of "time" then the version you should use is competely incidential
13:52 <audreyt> I'll reserve that for my next art project. :)
...reset...
14:00 <audreyt> may I quote you (under CC0 license!) in the commit log and Changes file? :)
14:01 <nothingmuch> i relinquish all rights to my wisdom or lack thereof
14:01 <nothingmuch> (hopefully i give up responsibility too ;-)
14:02 <audreyt> you do :D there was no responsibility to begin with
...shift...
13:52 <nothingmuch> in fact, software does not exist
13:53 <audreyt> it's the very nonexistence that makes it work... that is the essence of मध्यमिक
13:53 <audreyt> Nagarjuna was very much a hacker
13:54 <audreyt> it's said that Nagarjuna comprehended pretty much everything, and practiced shadow nijutsu and hacked into the 
                royal residence during adolescence
13:54 <audreyt> along with a peer, who got caught by the royal guard and promptedly killed
13:55 <audreyt> so Nagarjuna sat down and wrote Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way and Seventy Verses on Emptiness, 
                effectively hacked the indic culture into Hegel's shape, just much earlier...
13:56 <audreyt> then Tang XuanZang ported it to Chinese during Emperor Lee's reign (Tang and Lee happens to be my parents' 
                families)
13:56 <audreyt> as the Heart Sutra
13:57 <audreyt> "Essence of Wisdom Sutra", which is chanted everyday in CJKV by common people
13:57 <audreyt> I ported that to Unix a couple weeks ago as 
13:57 <audreyt>     sync;sync;shutdown -k;halt -lnqu
...comefrom...
14:02 <audreyt> "sync; sync; sudo sync; sudo shutdown -k; sudo halt -lnqu"
14:03 <audreyt> was my (working) translation
...goto...
13:58 <audreyt> which is what I now use daily whenever I get into an online situation where flamewar is immediate
13:58 <audreyt> ...so I gets (as promised by the Sutra) absolute immunity over flamewars
13:58 <nothingmuch> §=)
13:58 <audreyt> ...now I'd just have to do that again in realspace too :)
13:58 <audreyt> .
13:58 <nothingmuch> i wonder what that typo means
13:59 <nothingmuch> perhaps it's an enlightened smiley
13:59 <audreyt> converging infinity? :)
13:59 <audreyt> yeah, it's beautiful
...last...
14:04 <audreyt> well, translations evolve, too :) we'll probably revisit many times with reified control...
14:05 <audreyt> in realspace though, it's 10pm and I gotta go home and sleep. ttyl!
14:05 <nothingmuch> ciao ciao
14:05 <nothingmuch> i need to do laundry and rehearse myself
14:06 <audreyt> :D see ya!
